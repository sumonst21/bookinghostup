== Changelog ==

= 1.1.0, Sep 18 2018 =

  * Introducing attributes. By using the attributes you are able to define extra accommodation data such as location and type and use these attributes in the search availability form as advanced search filters.
  * Improved the way to display the booking rules in the availability calendar.
  * Added the new payment method to pay on arrival.
  * Added the ability to create fixed amount coupon codes.
  * Added the availability to send multiple emails to notify the administrator and other staff about new booking.

= 1.0.0, Aug 2 2018 =
* Hotel Booking plugin updated to version 2.7.6:
  * A new way to display available/unavailable dates in a calendar using a diagonal line (half-booked day). This will properly show your guests that they are able to use the same date as check in/out one.
  * Disabled predefined parameters for Adults and Children on the checkout page to let guests have more perceived control over options they choose.
  * Fixed the issue with booking rules and WPML. Now all translations of accommodations are not displayed in a list and the booking rules are applied to all translations.
  * Fixed the issue with Stripe when creating a booking from the backend.
  * Fixed the issue with the booking rules not applying while checking an accommodation availability with the "Skip search results" enabled.
  * Added a new feature "Guest Management". It is currently in beta and applied only to the frontend. Here are the main options of this feature:
    * Hide "adults" and "children" fields within search availability forms.
    * Disable "children" option for the website (hide "children" field and use Guests label instead).
    * Disable "adults" and "children" options.
  * Replaced "Per adult" label with a more catch-all term "per guest" for Services.
  * Increased the number of digits after comma for setting a per-night price. This will help you set accurate prices for weekly, monthly and custom rates.
  * Improved the way to display a rate pricing on the checkout page: the price is updated automatically based on the number of guests if there are any per-guest price variables.
  * Added the Availability Calendar shortcode.
  * Added sorting parameters to shortcodes.
  * Added all missing currencies to the list of currencies.
